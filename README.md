My name is Max Mäkinen, a software engineering sudent at the Hive Helsinki coding school.
In a previous life i've studied to become a goldsmith, then a blacksmith.
I've always enjoyed making things and I've really found the field of my dreams in software development, 
where my creativity is no longer bound by the restraints of the materails I'm working with.
Plus it's far cheaper to mess up and back up thanks to version control than with physical materials.

My current Portfolio pieces can be found here:<br>
